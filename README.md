***rpm-detector***


Easy to use rpm-detector for Arduino/ESP based microcontrollers.<br/>


Get the current speed of your motor (For example BLDC motors).<br/>

To start, change your signal Pin in the code to your own desired pin.<br/>
Now adjust the magnet amount.<br/>
After that, correct the wheel circumference of your installed wheel on the motor. (Keep gearings in mind, if any)<br/>
Upload the sketch on your microcontroller, and open the Serial monitor to see the results being printed.<br/>
The Serial plotter may also be used.</br>


The max speed of the detector is currently at around 50-60kmh, by adjusting an array size more is also possible.</br>
The amount of RAM used is around 31216 bytes on an ESP8266.



*Examples*:<br/>
Calculate the wheel Speed of your electric bobby car.<br/>

Your hub motor powered trash can needs solid speed measuring.<br/>

The fan at the ceiling has to be speed controlled.<br/>

+ There are endless possibilities, so be creative!<br/>
